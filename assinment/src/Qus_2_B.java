//question 2_B
//You are given an array of binary trees that represent different cities where a certain corporation has its branch
//office and the organization wishes to provide service by constructing a service center. Building service centers at
//any node, i.e., a city can give service to its directly connected cities where it can provide service to its parents,
//itself, and its immediate children. Returns the smallest number of service centers required by the corporation to
//provide service to all connected cities. Note that: the root node represents the head office and other connected
//nodes represent the branch office connected to the head office maintaining some kind of hierarchy.
//Input: tree= {0,0, null, 0, null, 0, null, null, 0}
//Output: 2
//Explanation: construction of two service centers denoted by black markk will be enough to provide service to all
//cities.
